| Pressure Controlled Ventilation | PCV | A set pressure is delivered for the period of inspiration and the volume achieved is measured and displayed. Ideally PRVC, an adaptive mode where the tidal volume is set, and the lowest possible pressure is delivered to achieve this volume. PCV where the user has to provide the adaptive control to achieve tidal volume is only acceptable if the tidal volume delivered is clearly displayed and the user can set patient specific upper and lower tidal volume alarms to alert to the need to adjust the pressure [1].
| Volume Controlled Ventilation | VCV | The user sets a tidal volume and Respiratory Rate. The tidal volume is delivered during the inspiratory period. Acceptable only if additional pressure limiting controls are available, see Inspiratory Pressure section [1].
| Positive End Expiratory Pressure | PEEP | The pressure maintained in the breathing system during expiration[1].
| Respiratory Rate | RR | The number of breathing cycles every minute[1].
| Inspiratory: Expiratory ratio | I:E | The proportion of each breathing cycle that is spent breathing in compared to breathing out.
| FiO2 | |  inspired oxygen proportion.[1]
| Critical Systems Labs | CSL | Critical Systems Labs is a Canadian-owned engineering consultancy with expertise in the management of safety risk and security vulnerabilities associated with complex hardware/software intensive systems. CSL has partnered with COSMIC Medical to assist in the project development, software process, and risk analysis of the gVent design-build. 
| Centimeters of water | cmH2O | Unit of pressure used in clinical settings for ventilation systems.

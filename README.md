## The Gravity Ventilator (gVent) 
### The Idea

In February 2020 amidst the CoVid-19 pandemic, concerns about a global shortage of ventilators began to surface and these discussions rapidly became a reality. We sought out to find a local solution to the rapidly evolving crisis, working alongside the hundreds of open-source projects worldwide, aimed at tackling the same problem. 

We believe that we add a novel solution to a landscape dominated by automated bag-valve mask compression devices. Built using readily-available materials and utilizing resources routinely found at a patient’s bedside, our aims were to produce a device capable of being produced at a sub-$100 price point for low-resource settings, as well as a more robust model, both founded using the same principles.

NOTE: At this point, this device is NOT medically approved for human use, and as such, improper use can result in harm or death of the patient. It is still in its development stages and any use in the clinical setting should be under the strict consultation and supervision of qualified healthcare experts and/or engineers.

### The Design

Modern commercial ventilators are complex machines with specialized components. According to the Department of Health and Social Care guidance statement on Rapidly Manufactured Ventilator System Specification (20/03/2020), ventilators must meet certain criteria to be considered “clinically acceptable”.

RMVS-compatible ventilators must be capable of providing one of two modes of ventilation. The first is mandatory ventilation, wherein the patient is completely sedated, and all work of breathing must be done by the ventilator, according to preset criteria (e.g. tidal volume, respiratory rate, E/I ratio). Supportive ventilation, on the other hand, is used when the patient can do some work on their own. The machine must be able to sense when the patient is attempting to inhale (and provide inspiratory support), and when the patient is exhaling (and provide expiratory support).


#### **How does it work?**

The basis of the gVent system is gravity, water, and two cylindrical vessels fitted together to create a pressurized system. This pressure can then be used to ventilate a sick patient. The two vessels are each sealed at one end. The larger vessel is filled with water; the smaller vessel is placed inside the larger vessel.

The basis of the gVent system is gravity, water and two cylindrical vessels that creates an inherently pressure-controlled system, capable of ventilating a sick patient. The two cylindrical vessels, each sealed at one end, are placed one-inside the other. Water is placed in the outside vessel, which creates a seal between the two vessels. Air is introduced into the system, using air supply from the hospital’s outlet. This allows the clinician to control the FiO2 by titrating the amount of hospital air vs O2 that is delivered. This pressurized gas builds up in the system, displacing the top pipe upwards from its resting position. The amount of pressure in the system is dictated by the weight of the top pipe, which can be modulated by the clinician.

Air/O2 builds up in the system and once the valve to the patient is opened, it is released through a port to the intubated patient. This valve is controlled on an electronic circuit, which gives the operator the ability to control respiratory rate, I:E ratio and the amount of volume delivered to the patient.

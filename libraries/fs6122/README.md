#FS6122 Bi-Directional Medical Respiratory Sensor - Measures Flow Rate & Gauge Pressure, Humidity & Temp Driver #

This driver is for the FS6122 Bi-Directional Medical Respiratory Sensor (http://www.siargo.us/fs6122-mass-flow-sensor.html), and is based on the Arduino Wire library and utilizing the i2c bus protocol.

## About the FS6122 Bi-Directional Medical Respiratory Sensor ##

The FS6122 is a medical respiratory sensor to measure from -250 to +250 SLPM with a linear analog output or I2C output.  A gauge pressure sensor is integrated into the FS6122 with a range of -5 to +40 cc H2O with a linear analog or I2C output.

More information on the FS6122 can be found in the datasheet: https://www.servoflo.com/download-archive/data-sheets/254-mass-flow-vacuum-sensors/1220-fs6122-datasheet
